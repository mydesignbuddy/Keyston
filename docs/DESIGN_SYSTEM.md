# Keyston Design System

> **Note:** For implementation guidelines, see [`docs/mockups/guidelines/Guidelines.md`](./mockups/guidelines/Guidelines.md). When building UI from Figma, always reference the exported code example in [`docs/mockups/`](./mockups/) as the starting point for your Ionic React implementation.


## Overview

The Keyston Design System provides design tokens, components, and rules for a consistent, accessible, and privacy-first user experience. **All UI implementation must follow the [Keyston Ionic Implementation Guidelines](./mockups/guidelines/Guidelines.md)** and use Figma code exports from [`docs/mockups/`](./mockups/) as the base for UI structure and layout.

**Key Principles:**
- **Privacy-First**: Visual design that reinforces user data ownership
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color contrast and interactions
- **Consistency**: Unified visual language across all screens
- **Fitness-Focused**: Colors and typography optimized for health data visualization
